                    <p>"Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a flashy starring debut for Miles, telling as engaging a story as the original Marvel’s Spider-Man while simultaneously improving upon pretty much every minor gripe would have had with that great game. It may be smaller overall, but every facet of it feels more essential: the incredible swinging mechanics, storytelling, and animation of Peter Parker’s adventure return, joined by meaningful updates to side missions, Miles’ flashy new moves, and the captivating spirit of New York City."</p>

There is introduction of the rope to game-play, as well as some ante upping on stealth mode are wonderful additions. The adventure in the game is brilliant."</p>
